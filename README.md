# Capstone Project
For my capstone project during the last year of my undergraduate program, I chose to implement a machine-learning model and test its accuracy.
I completed programming the standard Recurrent Neural Network, tested the model, and ran it. I also implemented Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), a type of RNN model (figure 3).

I taught myself the fundamentals while implementing the vector code (figure 1) and had to learn how to change the format of the data before inputting it into my model which was extremely difficult to grasp in the time I had. I used a dataset (Boston Housing Dataset) that was already formatted to ensure my model's accuracy and to compare the loss function between the RNN model (figure 5) and the LSTM model which is a subset of RNN (figure 3).

I was successfully able to complete the backpropagation algorithm (figure 2) and although it was extremely complicated to understand at first the diagrams helped in breaking down the concept. I also had to understand the functions of the packages required such as numpy, matplotlib, and Lincoln.

I did run into an issue with the application I chose to run my program on as I initially chose to work with Jupyter Notebook however there was an error with running the Lincoln package and I wasnâ€™t able to debug it. Instead, I chose to use Datalore as it was a lot easier to visualize the data and graphs and the packages ran smoothly although it did take a while to run the program as I had a significant amount of layers in my network and had to debug quite a bit. The program ran successfully in the end and I was able to compare how much of the human language the models could comprehend (figures 4 and 6).
